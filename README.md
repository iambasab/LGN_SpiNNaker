Modelling the Lateral Geniculate Nucleus with 3 cell populations consisting of Izhikevich neuron models. The extrinsic input is assumed to be from retinal spiking neurons when stimulated with trains of spike at a constant frequency. The output will simulate a Local Field Potential signal, which is the average membrane potential of a tightly packed neuronal population in around 0.3 sq mm of neuronal tissue.
The total number of neurons in the population is 1000. Thus far in our models, the time resolution was kept at 1 msec. However, due to some problems with 1000 neuronal network running on SpiNNaker, the time resolution is now reduced to 0.1 msec (100 micro-second).
